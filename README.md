# Image-Based-Entity-Value-Extraction-for-Automated-Data-Recognition
In this project, I developed a machine learning pipeline to extract entity values (e.g., weight, volume, dimensions) from product images. Using EasyOCR and computer vision models, I built a system for value prediction in structured formats, leveraging Google Cloud Vision API and custom algorithms for feature extraction.
