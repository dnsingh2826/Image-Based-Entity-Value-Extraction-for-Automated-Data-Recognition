To complete your project step-by-step, here’s what you should do along with the relevant technologies and frameworks:

### Step 1: **Set up the environment**
- **Technologies**: Python
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`
- **Frameworks**: Jupyter Notebook (for development and testing)
  
**Tasks**:
- Install necessary libraries and set up your workspace.
- Load the CSV file using `pandas` to access the image URLs and entity columns.

### Step 2: **Download images from URLs**
- **Technologies**: `requests`, `os`
  
**Tasks**:
- Write a function to download images from the URLs in your CSV file and save them locally for processing.

### Step 3: **Image Preprocessing**
- **Technologies**: OpenCV or `Pillow`
  
**Tasks**:
- Preprocess images (resize, grayscale, etc.) to optimize them for text extraction. This step helps improve text detection by enhancing image quality.

### Step 4: **Text Detection**
- **Technologies**: **OpenCV** (for object detection) or **TensorFlow**/ **PyTorch** with a pre-trained model like **EAST** or **CRAFT**.
  
**Tasks**:
- Use a text detection model to find the region of interest (ROI) where the text is located in the image. You can use OpenCV’s `EAST` detector to locate text blocks in the image.

### Step 5: **Text Recognition (OCR)**
- **Technologies**: **Tesseract OCR**, or **EasyOCR**
  
**Tasks**:
- Apply Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to the detected text regions. This step converts the detected text in images to machine-readable text.

### Step 6: **Entity Mapping**
- **Technologies**: Python, NLP libraries (optional)
  
**Tasks**:
- For each image, extract the relevant value based on the entity type (e.g., weight, voltage). Use pattern matching or simple rules to map the detected text to the required entity.

### Step 7: **Train a Machine Learning Model (Optional)**
- **Technologies**: **TensorFlow**, **PyTorch**
  
**Tasks**:
- If accuracy needs improvement, consider training a custom model to learn which regions in an image correspond to each entity type. You could fine-tune an object detection model for this.

### Step 8: **Post-processing and Formatting**
- **Technologies**: Python
- **Libraries**: `re` (for regex)
  
**Tasks**:
- Clean and format the extracted text to ensure it matches the expected format (e.g., “2.5 V” for voltage).
  
### Step 9: **Output Results**
- **Technologies**: `pandas`
  
**Tasks**:
- Save the results to a CSV file in the required format, similar to the `sample_test_out.csv` you were provided.

### Step 10: **Validation**
- **Technologies**: Sanity check script provided in the competition
  
**Tasks**:
- Run the sanity checker on the output file to ensure the formatting is correct.

### Summary of Technologies:
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV, Pillow
- **Text Detection**: OpenCV (EAST), CRAFT, TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Text Recognition (OCR)**: Tesseract, EasyOCR
- **Machine Learning (Optional)**: TensorFlow, PyTorch
- **Data Handling**: pandas, numpy
